# User Personas and Stories
- __Buzz__ is a 35 year old technical recruiter.
	- __Goal__: review Ben's core proficiencies to see if he matches any open roles he is recruiting for, as quickly as possible. He is hoping to confirm proficiencies match for his job, find a resume, and send it back to his client in under a minute.
	- Background: Buzz has an undergraduate degree in business and has been a technical recruiter role for the past 3 years.
	- __Skills__: Buzz is adept at searching the web but does not consider himself to be in a technical role. He doesn't need to understand the architecture or ins-and-outs of the projects of those he interviews, rather he's trying to get a sense of the person behind it all, and how well they can communicate their ideas, strengths, and career paths.
	- __Process__: Buzz visits the site during business and after hours via his laptop. He will usually network and get others hired by sending small urls back and forth via email or sending out word documents on his updates
	- __Story:__ Buzz find my site listed on my linkedIn page. From my home page he views an image of me, a short snippet about my background and then scrolls down to view my core competancies. He selects one of a few roles I have listed as marketing myself for (in this case it is a back-end software engineer for a Life Sciences company) and he sees a timeline of notable achievements and projects that demonstrate some of my core competancies. He likes what he sees and clicks on the resume link at the top of the Nav Bar, and a .pdf copy of my resume automaically downloads. He wants to get a sense of my personality, so he clicks on the "About Me" page to get a better sense of what I'm like. Buzz reaches out to me using the email listed at the footer of the site, and sends a copy of my link and resume (in pdf format) to his client.

- __Harper__ is a 28 year old former colleague from MedTech Inc.
  - __Goal__: Harper worked with Ben back at MedTech and is curious to see what Ben is upto nowadays. She likes to scroll through LinkedIn on her breaks sometimes.
  - __Skills__: Harper is a software engineer herself and is very adept at many different back-end technologies and firmware. She isn't a front-end engineer however.
  - __Process__: Harper is scrolling through LinkeIn and is curious what Ben is working on now. She visits his profile via LinkedIn on her mobile phone and clicks on the website he has linked.
  - __Story__: Harper visits Ben's site from her mobile phone and quickly scrolls past a few of his projects. She isn't super interested in the details beyond just a few titles and visuals. She navigates to his "About Me" page to get the latest dose of his cat pictures! She wants to share some of the cutest pictures so she copies the URL and shares it with a few co-workers!

- __Lucy__ is a 40 year old Software Engineering manager for BioHealth LTD.
	- __Goal__: Lucy is reviewing job applications for the Software engineering position she's hiring for.
	- __Skills__: Lucy comes from a technical background (having worked at BioHealth for 8 years starting as a Junior Developer). Although she's primarily a back-end engineer, she has worked across all facets of the company's platform and has enough fluency to work at the high level strategy level while still providing technical assistance for bug analysis and story development.
	- __Process__: Lucy usually works on stories is in meetings during the day (only one of which is related to recruiting). She will usually look through resumes later in the night since she doesn't need to be checking in with others for the process. She switches between browsing through emails on her phone and looking through some applications on her laptop.
	- __Story__: Ben's job application seems just fine on paper and she notices a link to his personal page. Amid the 40 other applications she's reviewed that night alone it is hard to have applications  stand out, but seeing Ben's skills stand out makes an impression. Additionally his website is simple to navigate from both her phone and laptop, automatically enters dark mode, and is not filled with walls of text. She adds the URL to her shortlist of candiates to review the next day with her team.
