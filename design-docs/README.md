# Target Audience
This website is designed for potential employers, friends, and family to learn more about me, my professional experience, and some of the things I like to do for fun!

# User Stories
- Employer: an employer is provided a link to the home page from my resume, linkedin, or a job application. Directly from the home page the user sees highlighted projects. At the top nav bar they can navigate to my resume, which is specifically formatted to show how my academic and professional backgrounds contribute to my career. A link to the resume in .pdf format and a link to my LinkedIn account is provided as well. Finally, the employer can open up the "About Me" page to get a sense of my personality, likes, and interests!
- Colleague: a former classmate or colleague might be interested in what I'm up to nowadays and check out my homepage from my LinkedIn account. From there they will see listings of my highlighted projects as well as a link to my hobbies and personal projects.
- Friends and Family: I might give out my website url in-person or via a direct message link. The user opens up the link on their phone and learns more about a project I might be explaining in-person or via chat, using the highlighted blurbs and images on the site to guide them. The body of text in each page isn't as important as the visuals.
